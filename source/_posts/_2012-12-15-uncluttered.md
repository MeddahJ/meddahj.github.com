<style type="text/css">
	.hidden { display:none; }
</style>

<script type="text/coffeescript">
	jQuery ->
		jQuery('.gol').click ->
			jQuery('.gol').toggleClass('hidden')
</script>


In which language is written the code below? This may be a trap...

[![](/images/GOL_I.png){:class="gol"}]

[![](/images/GOL_II.png){:class="gol hidden"}]



The new _Darcula_ IntelliJ theme is really nice, the syntax colouring schemes that go along... not so much. 

Unseen in Eclipse, IntelliJ's scheme editor has more possibilities than in Eclipse. Like custom colors for curly braces, or semi-colons.

And what better colors for curly braces and semi-colons? ...

And there you have it: Python/Haskell look-alike code for the entreprise developer

At some point I used to have an opinion about indent style, probably like this one (http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cayhorstmann/archive/2010/06/28/horstmann-brace-style#comment-15474)

Is it because the widely accepted style, and Eclipse's default , who knows?

Uncluttered, play nice with team and versionning, but not with pair


Use to choose between K&R and Allman, no I don't care => hate brackets anyway


Length to go to to hide java's ugliness (morlhon tweets, various intellij stuff (imports, diamonds, â€¦))


Compare with Ceylon and stuff
